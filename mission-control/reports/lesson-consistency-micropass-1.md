# Lesson Consistency Micro-Pass 1: Completion Report

**Date:** 2026-05-24  
**Scope:** Targeted fixes from `lesson-consistency-audit.md`  
**Reference files:** `lesson_phases-of-the-moon.html`, `lesson_sun-earth-moon.html`

---

## Files Edited

### 1. `lesson_what-is-life.html`
**Issues fixed:**
- Added full `stem-detail` CSS block (`.stem-detail`, `.stem-show-btn`, `.stem-detail-body`, `.stem-std-row`, `.stem-std-code`, `.stem-std-text`), this file had neither the CSS nor the HTML, unlike the other two.
- Added `stem-detail` HTML block with standard descriptions for `6.MS-LS1-1` and `6.MS-LS1-2`.
- Added `toggleStemDetail()` JS function to the existing sessionStorage script block.
- Updated `ls-focus-label`: `MA STE Standards · Grade 6` → `📋 MA STE Standards · Grade 6`
- Updated `ls-focus-label`: `Learning Science Focus` → `🔬 Learning Science Focus`
- Added emoji prefixes to all 5 ls-badges: `🖼️ Dual Coding`, `🏗️ Scaffolding`, `🗂️ Concept Formation`, `✅ Retrieval Practice`, `⚖️ Load Management`

### 2. `lesson_body-systems.html`
**Issues fixed:**
- Added `stem-detail` HTML block with standard description for `6.MS-LS1-3`.
- Added `toggleStemDetail()` JS function to the existing sessionStorage script block (also cleaned up a duplicate `stem-active` check that was in the original one-liner).

**Notes:**
- CSS for `stem-detail` was already present, only the HTML and JS were missing.

### 3. `lesson_organelles.html`
**Issues fixed:**
- Added `stem-detail` HTML block with standard descriptions for `6.MS-LS1-1` and `6.MS-LS1-2`.
- Added `toggleStemDetail()` JS function between the sessionStorage script and the stars canvas script.

**Notes:**
- CSS for `stem-detail` was already present, only the HTML and JS were missing.
- The original stem-focus closing `</div>` was inline with the last `<span>` on the same line; the edit correctly placed it on its own line before the new `stem-detail` div.

### 4. `lesson_continental-drift.html`
**Issues fixed:**
- Updated `ls-focus-label`: `Learning Science Focus` → `🔬 Learning Science Focus`
- Added emoji prefixes to all 5 ls-badges:
  - `Phenomenon-First` → `🔍 Phenomenon-First`
  - `Chunked Content` → `🧠 Chunked Content`
  - `Dual Coding` → `🖼️ Dual Coding`
  - `Retrieval Practice` → `✅ Retrieval Practice`
  - `Evidence Reasoning` → `📊 Evidence Reasoning`

**Notes:**
- This file already had `stem-detail` HTML, CSS, and the `toggleStemDetail()` JS function, no stem changes needed.

## Issues Intentionally Left Unchanged

### `.hero-floats` in `lesson_body-systems.html`
The audit flagged `.hero-floats` (plural) as a possible typo vs. `.hero-float` (singular) used in most other files. On inspection, both the CSS rule and the 4 HTML elements (`🫀 🦴 🧠 🫁`) all use `class="hero-floats"` consistently. The feature renders correctly. This is intentional naming, the class was defined and used as plural from the start in this file.

**Decision:** Left unchanged. Not a bug.

## MA STE Standard Code Format: Audit Note (No Edits)

Four distinct code formats appear across the lesson library. All are legitimate MA STE codes, the inconsistency reflects the actual standard numbering scheme, not formatting errors. No normalisation was applied.

| Format | Example | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `6.MS-LS1-X` | `6.MS-LS1-1` | what-is-life, organelles |
| `6.MS-ESS1-1a` | `6.MS-ESS1-1a` | phases-of-the-moon, sun-earth-moon, eclipses (corrected June 2026) |
| `6.ESS2-X` | `6.ESS2-3` | continental-drift, layers-of-time |
| `SEP-X` | `SEP-4` | continental-drift (engineering practice) |

The `6.` prefix appears on Grade 6-specific MA adaptations. `MS-` prefix appears on middle school NGSS-aligned standards. `SEP-` is a Science and Engineering Practice code, not a content standard. **Note (June 2026):** The `6.ESS2-2` code has been removed from all pages as it does not exist in the MA 2016 STE Framework. The astronomy pages have been corrected from `MS-ESS1-1` to `6.MS-ESS1-1a`.

## Recommended Next Micro-Pass

1. **Audit remaining files**, `lesson_sun-earth-moon.html` ls-badges should be verified for emoji consistency; it was used as a reference but not audited for missing prefixes.
2. **`stem-focus-label` 📋 prefix**, Only `what-is-life` had this fixed in this pass. Check that all files using `stem-focus-label` have the `📋` prefix for visual consistency.
3. **ls-badge emoji audit sweep**, Run a grep for `class="ls-badge"` across all lesson files and verify each badge has an emoji prefix. This pass only fixed the two files called out in the audit.
4. **Standard descriptions for `lesson_ragebaiting.html`**, If that file ever needs a stem-detail block, it was explicitly excluded from this pass and will need its own micro-pass.
